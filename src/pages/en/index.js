        <h2>Welcome to Path to Body and Health</h2>
        <p>
          In daily life, I work in the field of well-being at work as a safety
          consultant. But on this website you will find everything about my work
          as a self-employed person: your personal Intimacy and Health Coach!
          I specialise in a holistic view of health, and in the topics of 
          Sex, Love, and Relationships through the VITAâ„¢ Method. 
          This for individuals longing for that spark in their relation or life by creating a deep connection with themselves!
